        "-The difference between a **function** and a **method** in Python lies primarily in their context of usage and the way they are called:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Function:**\n",
        "- A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.\n",
        "- It is defined using the `def` keyword and can exist **outside of a class**.\n",
        "- Functions can be called directly by their name (if they are in the same scope or properly imported).\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def greet(name):\n",
        "      return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",

        "  print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Method:**\n",
        "- A **method** is essentially a function that is **associated with an object** and is defined within a class.\n",
        "- It is called **on an instance of the class** (or the class itself for class methods).\n",
        "- Methods often take `self` (for instance methods) or `cls` (for class methods) as their first parameter to refer to the instance or class they belong to.\n",

        "2. **Provide an Output**: The `return` statement specifies the value that the function will send back to the caller. This value can be of any data type (e.g., number, string, list, dictionary, etc.), or it can be `None` if no value is explicitly returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Facilitate Reusability**: By returning a value, the function can provide a result that can be used elsewhere in the program, allowing for modular and reusable code.\n",

        "-Generators in Python are a way to create iterators in a concise and efficient manner. Unlike normal functions, which return a single value using the `return` statement, generators use the `yield` statement to produce a sequence of values over time, pausing their execution and resuming from where they left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features of Generators:\n",
        "1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators produce values one at a time, which makes them memory-efficient for large datasets or streams of data.\n",
        "2. **State Retention**: Generators retain their state between successive calls, so computation can continue seamlessly from the last yielded value.\n",

        "3. **Simpler Code**: Avoids the complexity of managing state in traditional iterator implementations.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "7.\tWhat are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "-Using **generators** over regular functions provides several advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency, performance, and simplicity for certain types of problems. Here's a breakdown of their benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Memory Efficiency**\n",
        "   - **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators produce items one at a time, only when needed, instead of computing and storing all values at once. This is especially useful for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "   - **Reduced Memory Usage**: Since generators do not store all the values in memory, they are more memory-efficient than returning a large list.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def generator_function():\n",
        "       for i in range(1000000):\n",
        "           yield i\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Memory-efficient iteration\n",
        "   for number in generator_function():\n",
        "       print(number)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Improved Performance**\n",
        "   - **Faster Initialization**: Generators start yielding values immediately without waiting to compute the entire dataset, which can improve performance in scenarios where you only need a subset of the results.\n",
        "   - **Streamlined Processing**: Generators work well with streaming data, allowing for efficient real-time processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Simplified Code for Iterators**\n",
        "   - **Readable State Management**: Generators automatically maintain their state between iterations, unlike regular functions where you might need to manage state explicitly using loops, counters, or other constructs.\n",
        "   - **Ease of Implementation**: Creating custom iterators is simpler with generators compared to manually implementing `__iter__` and `__next__` methods in classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def countdown(n):\n",
        "       while n > 0:\n",
        "           yield n\n",
        "           n -= 1\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Supports Infinite Sequences**\n",
        "   - Generators are ideal for representing infinite sequences because they compute values on demand without consuming memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def infinite_numbers(start=0):\n",
        "       while True:\n",
        "           yield start\n",
        "           start += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "   for number in infinite_numbers():\n",
        "       print(number)  # Stops only when explicitly broken\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Enhanced Compatibility with Pipelines**\n",
        "   - Generators integrate seamlessly into data processing pipelines, such as those involving functional programming paradigms like `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Error Handling During Iteration**\n",
        "   - Generators allow you to handle errors or cleanup resources gracefully using the `try` and `finally` blocks within the generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def file_reader(file_path):\n",
        "       with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n",
        "           for line in f:\n",
        "               yield line.strip()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Generators:\n",
        "   - When working with large datasets that do not fit into memory.\n",
        "   - When processing streams of data or real-time data feeds.\n",
        "   - When you need to generate values on demand or represent infinite sequences.\n",
        "   - When you want to simplify code for stateful iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators make code efficient, cleaner, and more Pythonic for scenarios where computation and memory management need to be optimized.\n",

        "8.\tWhat is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "-A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions can have only a single expression and are often used when a simple function is needed for a short period.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax\n",
        "```python\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `expression` is evaluated and returned automatically when the lambda function is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# A lambda function to add two numbers\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics\n",
        "1. **Anonymous**: Lambda functions don't have a name unless assigned to a variable.\n",
        "2. **Single Expression**: They can only contain a single line of code.\n",
        "3. **Lightweight**: They are often used for short, concise functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Use Cases\n",
        "1. **As an argument to higher-order functions**:\n",
        "   Functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` often take lambda functions as arguments.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   squares = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
        "   print(list(squares))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **In sorting with custom keys**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   words = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "   sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda x: len(x))\n",
        "   print(sorted_words)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quick one-time use**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   result = (lambda x, y: x * y)(5, 6)\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 30\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "- Lambda functions are limited to a single expression and cannot include statements or annotations.\n",
        "- They can be harder to read and debug compared to regular functions when used in complex situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used when a simple, throwaway function is needed for a short period, and defining a full function with `def` would be unnecessary or cumbersome.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9.\tExplain the purpose and usage of the 'map()' function in Python\n",
        "-The `map()` function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and return a new map object (an iterator) containing the results. It is particularly useful for performing element-wise operations in a concise and functional programming style.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose**\n",
        "The primary purpose of the `map()` function is to simplify and streamline the process of applying the same operation to multiple elements in an iterable, avoiding the need for explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "map(function, iterable, *iterables)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`function`**: The function to apply to the items of the iterable(s).\n",
        "- **`iterable`**: The primary iterable whose items will be passed to the function.\n",
        "- **`*iterables`**: Additional iterables (optional). If multiple iterables are provided, the function should accept arguments corresponding to the number of iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How It Works**\n",
        "1. The `map()` function applies the `function` to the first item of each iterable, then the second item, and so on.\n",
        "2. It stops processing when the shortest iterable is exhausted.\n",
        "3. The result is a map object, which is an iterator. You can convert it to a list, tuple, or other collections to see the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example Usage**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single Iterable**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example: Convert a list of numbers to their squares\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "squares = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
        "print(list(squares))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multiple Iterables**\n",
        "```python\n",

        "list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
        "sums = map(lambda x, y: x + y, list1, list2)\n",
        "print(list(sums))  # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using a Predefined Function**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example: Convert a list of strings to uppercase\n",
        "def to_uppercase(s):\n",
        "    return s.upper()\n",
        "\n",

        "### **Advantages**\n",
        "- Concise and readable way to apply functions to iterables.\n",
        "- Avoids writing explicit loops.\n",
        "- Works seamlessly with lambda functions and predefined functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Limitations**\n",
        "- Only processes items up to the shortest iterable when multiple iterables are provided.\n",
        "- Returns a map object, so you must explicitly convert it to a list, tuple, or set to view the results.\n",
        "- May not be the most Pythonic choice in simple cases where list comprehensions can achieve the same result more clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Alternative**\n",
